# Homework {.unnumbered}

**Setup**

1. Download the [module5_model.zip](data/module5_model.zip){download="module5_model.zip"} file.
2. Create a new project folder for this homework.
3. Extract the contents of `module5_model.zip` into a `data` subfolder within your project folder. Your project structure should look something like below.
```{powershell}
Your_Project_Folder/
├── data/
│   ├── Dyrup_uncalibrated.mupp
│   ├── Dyrup_uncalibrated.sqlite
│   └── ... (other files from the zip)
└── Module5_Homework.ipynb  (or your script)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
This is the exact same model that was used in Module 4 Homework, and for the content of Module 5.
:::

**Exercise 1**

1.  Create a Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
2.  Import the `mikeplus` package as `mp`.
3.  Open the `Dyrup_uncalibrated.sqlite` database from your `data` subfolder using a context manager (`with mp.open(...) as db:`).
4.  Inside the context manager:
    - Print the database version.
    - Print the name of the active model configuration.
    - Print the name of the active scenario.
5.  Retrieve all MUIDs from the `msm_Catchment` table and print the first 5 MUIDs.
6.  Retrieve the `Area`, `ModelAConcTime`, and `ModelARFactor` for all catchments and display the head of the resulting DataFrame.

**Exercise 2**

::: {.callout-note}
For this exercise, make a copy of `Dyrup_uncalibrated.sqlite` (e.g., `Dyrup_uncalibrated_ex2_copy.sqlite`) and work with this copy.
:::

1.  Open your copied database.
2.  Select the catchments with MUIDs 'G61F080_7311' and 'G61F375_7353'. Display their current `ModelAConcTime`.
3.  Update the `ModelAConcTime` for these two catchments to `1800` seconds.
4.  Verify the change by selecting and displaying the `ModelAConcTime` for these two catchments again.
5.  Close the database.

**Exercise 3**

::: {.callout-note}
Continue working with a fresh copy of the original database or the copy from Exercise 2.
:::

1.  Open your copied database.
2.  Identify the alternative group that contains catchment data (Hint: its name likely involves "Catchments" or "hydrology"). Store this `AlternativeGroup` object.
3.  Create a new alternative named "High_ConcTime_AllCatchments" within this group, making it a child of the group's base alternative.
4.  Create a new scenario named "Scenario_High_Tc", making it a child of the base scenario.
5.  Assign the "High_ConcTime_AllCatchments" alternative to the "Scenario_High_Tc" scenario.
6.  Activate the "Scenario_High_Tc" scenario and confirm it was activated.
7.  Within this active scenario ("Scenario_High_Tc" with "High_ConcTime_AllCatchments" active for catchments):
    - Update the `ModelAConcTime` for *all* catchments in the `msm_Catchment` table to `3600` seconds.
8.  Verify the change:
    - While "Scenario_High_Tc" is active, select and display the `ModelAConcTime` for a few catchments (e.g., the first 3 MUIDs from `msm_Catchment`). They should show `3600`.
    - Activate the base scenario.
    - Select and display the `ModelAConcTime` for the same catchments. They should show their original values (e.g., `1200.0` if unchanged from the original database).
9.  Close the database.

**Exercise 4**

::: {.callout-note}
Continue working with the database copy you modified in Exercise 3 (the one with "Scenario_High_Tc").
:::

1.  Open the database copy from Exercise 3.
2.  Retrieve the simulation setup with MUID 'rainfall' from the `msm_Project` table.
3.  Update this 'rainfall' simulation setup to use your "Scenario_High_Tc" scenario by setting its `ScenarioName` column.
4.  Verify that the `ScenarioName` for the 'rainfall' simulation setup in `msm_Project` is now "Scenario_High_Tc".
5.  Run the 'rainfall' simulation.
6.  Print the list of result files generated.
7.  Close the database.

**Exercise 5**

::: {.callout-note}
Start with a fresh copy of the original `Dyrup_uncalibrated.sqlite` database (e.g., `Dyrup_uncalibrated_ex5_copy.sqlite`). This exercise will create many scenarios and run multiple simulations, which can take some time.
:::

The goal is to investigate the impact of `ModelAConcTime` and `ModelARFactor` for *all* catchments on the simulation results.

1.  Define two Python lists:
    - `conc_times_sec = [1200, 1500, 1800, 2100, 2400]` (these are 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 minutes in seconds)
    - `r_factors = [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]`
2.  Open your copied database.
3.  Get the "Catchments and hydrology data" alternative group object.
4.  Loop through each combination of `conc_time` from `conc_times_sec` and `r_factor` from `r_factors`. For each of the 25 combinations:
    a.  Create a unique alternative name, e.g., `Tc{tc}_Rf{rf}`.
    b.  Create a new alternative in the "Catchments and hydrology data" group using the unique name, parented to the group's base alternative.
    c.  Create a unique scenario name, e.g., `Tc{tc}_Rf{rf}`.
    d.  Create a new scenario using the unique name, parented to the database's base scenario.
    e.  Assign the newly created alternative to the newly created scenario.
    f.  Activate the new scenario.
    g.  In the active scenario, update `ModelAConcTime` to the current `tc` value and `ModelARFactor` to the current `rf` value for **all** catchments in the `msm_Catchment` table.
    h.  Update the simulation setup with MUID 'rainfall' in the `msm_Project` table to use the current `new_scenario.name` for its `ScenarioName` column.
    i.  Run the 'rainfall' simulation.
    j.  Print the current scenario name and the list of result files generated for this scenario. (Optionally, just print the name of the `.res1d` file containing network HD results).
5.  After the loop finishes, close the database.
6.  Open the model in MIKE+. Can you see your scenarios? Try activating a few and checking catchment parameters.

This set of exercises will guide you through the core functionalities of MIKE+Py, preparing you for more complex automated workflows. Good luck!
